# Ticket Client [![License: LGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL_v3-orange.svg)](COPYING.LESSER)
Ticket Client is an application for my dad thatâ€™s managing clients, work tickets and appointments in the IT sector. It is therefore divided into three main parts, where everything is governed by storage in a database and an API specifically for images. Besides storing very complex data, the application helps you with some features such as sending by e-mail, archiving, discharge contact list and a lot more.
